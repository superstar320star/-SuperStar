Hello,

Node.js is my focus that's why I'm interested in your job, but also I have experience with developing Bitсoin Merchant System - it's scalable and extremely secured bitcoin front office solution for cash exchange. Allows users to easily trade bitcoins for a number of foreign currencies. Modular architecture makes it easy to integrate the system with different crypto currency exchanges.

Here are also some recent examples of Node.js-based projects:

1. www.unreel.me - this is a large platform with the main goal to become a tool for content owners to distribute and monetize their media and to become a convenient and flexible tool for the media consumers. Using MEAN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js, Java.
2. lincolncenter.org/video - video portal, admin area and CMS for Lincoln Center portal. Using - Node.js and Less.

I'm open for communication so feel free to contact me for any details.

Thanks for your time and hope to hear you soon,

My expertise will be good addition to your project because of 3 reasons. And while the first one (my experience) is obvious, other ones differ me from other applicants.

Ok so the first and foremost - I have expertise with Blockchain. My Bitcoin related project as an example for you => https://goo.gl/Fjxzv5
I know ins and outs of this field and therefore do work fast and clean.

The second - I'm coding since 2011 andwhich means I can have experience comminicating with clients and definitely not make them wait for responce. And of course I can guarantee proper quality of the code, since I know pitfalls to avoid, approaches and techniques.
My code samples are available upon your request.

And the third but far not least - my experience with particular technologies:
JavaScript - 5,5 years
Node.js – 5 years

I hope information above is sufficient to consider my candidacy and interview me.

I'd really like to become a part of your team and looking forward to your reply!
Kind regards,
