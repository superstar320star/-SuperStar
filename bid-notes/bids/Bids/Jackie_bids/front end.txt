Hi,

I am a full stack developer specializing in Javascript stacks and highly interested and skilled in page designs with Javascript animations and CSS effects.

I always try to implement a pixel-perfect design based on graphics and give much attention to details.

Every project is taken seriously and I usually perform A/B testing to get the most out of the design, improve conversion rates and user experience overall.

While focusing on the quality, I don't ever compromise on the deadline unless any specific challenges arise.

Please check some of my past frontend works :

I provide seamless communication and provide daily updates to ensure we're always on the same page.

Ready for the interview so that we can get to know each other and get everything ready to start.

Thanks,
