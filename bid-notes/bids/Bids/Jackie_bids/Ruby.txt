Hello,

I'm a Senior developer who can learn any language/framework very quickly. I'm also a craftsman, and I take pride in writing clean, well tested, and well documented code. I don't cut corners.
Following references are my previous work with Ruby on Rails and React.

https://scarpawine.com (RoR back end and React front end)
http://rakam.io (Agile software development)
https://www.helpwith.co (React front end)
http://www.lucidoagency.com (Ruby on Rails)

As a self-motivated solutions-based developer, I built the component-based web applications with Redux and MVC architecture, and I coded the features in Rails 5.0+ back end. Also I developed the responsive and pixel perfect front end with React, Haml, Jade, and HTML5.

During the period, I focused on building the fast and reliable web applications with Ruby on Rails and React. I accomplished the state management with Redux structure and server-side rendering using rails and react-rails, webpack3.0 gems.
As a test driven developer, I also implemented the Unit testing, functional testing, component testing and UI testing using Rspec, cucumber, Jest and Enzyme.

I am flexible with working hours, so I can dedicate full time for this job on your timezone. And I can speak English fluently.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
