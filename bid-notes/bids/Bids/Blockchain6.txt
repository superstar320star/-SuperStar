Hi,

I need your actual requirements defined to estimate fixed price, by milestone.
If I work hourly, it is $250/hour, if I work based on milestones effective rate is about $100/hour.
I.e. to have fixed requirements is cheaper for you :-)

see possible milestones of regular NFT collection sales site:
1. server installation for NFT storage & site itself (linode: centos/nginx/security ..- $750
2. minting smartcontract - $2000
3. 'skeleton site' - only core user part (pay with Eth & get NFT), zero design..- $1500
4. 'skeleton site' - admin part (manage smartcontracts), zero design - $2000
(all above will work on testnet - Kovan, contracts will be verified on Kovan..)

5. video with full explanations - $1500 [optional, only if you need it]

[ after that will be frontend dev part (can recommend) - beatification of UI, testing..and when ready we will proceed to deploy on mainnet, guy I can recommend is $45 /hour]
6. deploy on mainnet support (will be done via zoom - i.e. you will do deploy from your wallet, I will support and help) - $500 [optional, if you need it]
7. verification on etherscan - free
8. help to add collection to OpenSea (remote)- $500 [optional, if you need it]

built a lot of NFT related smartcontracts (ERC721), also tokens as ERC20, also BEP20 (ERC20 on Binance Smart Chain), staking contracts, borrow.. and so on. Ethereum, BSC.. any Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
