Hi, I am Sidhanth, a full stack developer from India. I worked as a front end engineer at Poshmark (NASDAQ: POSH) primarily on VueJS and the general lifecycle of the project. I have over 5 years of experience in software development. I have worked on ReactJs, React Native, VueJS, NodeJs, ExpressJS, MongoDB and multiple CI/CD softwares to automate testing and deployments.

In Poshmark I worked on pages that have high user interactions (~1M requests a day), have implemented server-side rendering and used all the best practices to optimize the pages. We never used third party UI components/libraries and always preferred SASS, SCSS, Vanilla JS to get the job done. Apart from this, I have worked on the backend side developing API using NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. I have multiple apps live on the play store and app store that are created completely on React Native.

I am a quick learner. On Upwork, I am involved in a long term project that is ending this week. I had to use NuxtJS, Vue3 features like composition API, Auth0 SDK etc which I learnt quickly and implemented. The website we made is https://dev--ac-myplan.netlify.app/. I can get up to speed in any JS tech. I write clean maintainable code so that any other developer would not find it tough to take over. I use Git and will keep the client always in the loop with regular demos/updates.
