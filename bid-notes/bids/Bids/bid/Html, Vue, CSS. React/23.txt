I’m Biplab Mondal, a full stack javascript developer with 5+ years of professional working experience.

I am having working experience with React.js, Node js JavaScript, and TypeScript. I have also worked on real-time projects where the firebase database, Mongo DB has been used so I have an understanding of it as well.

Having already worked on projects where I had to play with redux, react hooks, RESTful APIs, Material UI, Isomorphic React, and Next js. I will most definitely help you with this.

Hi there,

It’s great to see you’re looking for a Web Developer to assist with your project!

Delivering a top-notch product within the set timeline is my main priority as I understand that it usually becomes crucial to business development as well as setting a proper tone in consumer relations.

Here are some relevant work examples which will help to strengthen your confidence in my skills & experience: http://bit.ly/vasylportfolio and https://bit.ly/devasyl

Working with the different SaaS, complex web platforms, and MVPs usually involves the following steps, which I can cover A-Z:
🔎 Outlining the business model, monetization system, defining personas, and preparing the user flows to describe the path a user takes when using a product;
💡 Building a sitemap – an architecture and hierarchy of the website/application pages;
📝 Transferring that vision into wireframes, a high-fidelity layout of web pages with a clickable system to test on users;
🧩 Defining the look and feel of the digital solution along with the UI Components for the pages;
🖼 Metamorphosing into UI design – an aesthetic and intuitive way to increase user loyalty along with the responsive versions to cover different resolutions.

Then it comes to the actual development process, where I can help you prepare the technical requirements, platform architecture, WBS, and select the APIs required for the project.

My tech stack covers the following technologies:
🖥 Layout: HTML5, CSS3, Sass/Less, Bootstrap, Material UI, Angular Material, Kendo UI, Ionic UI;
👨‍💻 Front-end: Javascript (ES6), Typescript;
⚡Frameworks: React.js, Vue.js;
🧱Back-end: PHP (Laravel, Symfony), Node.js, Python, WordPress, RESTful API;
🗄 Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, NoSQL;
⚙Supporting tools: Git (flow), Webpack/Gulp, npm/yarn, Docker;
✔Version control systems: Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Azure.

It would be great if you can devote your time for a quick chat to discuss your project in more detail so that I can see how I can help you and define the proper product strategy.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Respectfully,
Vasyl
