Hello there, I see that you are looking for an experienced full-stack developer highly skilled in VueJS/React/Javascript/CSS to join you and help you develop your website, and here I'm reaching out to you as this tech stack is something we are really good at and can definitely help you out with this.

If we talk about the required technical skills and expertise, we have over 7 years of experience working with Javascript/CSS and over 4 years of experience working with VueJS/ReactJS/Redux and have developed several high-end web applications. We can help you with the full-stack development of your website including frontend development, backend development, and DevOps. I just have a quick question though - do you have designs ready for the front end? If yes please share them with us so that we can review them and get a better understanding of the work. If you don't have the designs we can help you with the designs as well. Also, please share more details such as details about the features/functionalities that you want us to develop for your website.

We follow best practices when it comes to coding and make sure that our code is well documented and well-structured. Everyone here in my team is a fluent English speaker so there won't be any issue regarding communication between us. To showcase our relevant experience I'd like to share some of our top work with you below.
