As I front-end engineer I have strong experience of front-end libraries including React.js, RxJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, and Laravel.
Well, I think the most important things in RxJS are Operators.
An operator is simply a method that acts on an Observable and changes the stream in some way.
The purpose of the operator, to modify or filter originally emitted values in the way we need for the project tasks.

I am also familiar with React.
One of the most valuable parts of React is its component lifecycle, I think.
At the highest level, React components have lifecycle events that falls into three general categories:
- Initialization
- State/Property Updates
- Destruction
Understanding these three general categories should help you clearly visualize when certain logic needs to be applied.
For example, a component may need to add event listeners to the DOM when it first mounts.
However, it should probably remove those event listeners when the component unmounts from the DOM so that irrelevant processing does not occur.

Best regards.
