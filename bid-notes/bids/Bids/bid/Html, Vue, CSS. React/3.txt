It's a SaaS solution that shows the team workload, financial KPI of the company, calculates revenue and reflects indexes of the monthly company work.
In the attached files, you can see the screens of how the system works and React code sample.

The idea of the startup was to build a platform that will bring value for gamers, spectators and event organisers.

I don't want just to do tasks without thinking of product performance and optimisation, as I'm obsessed with code quality.
My goal for your project is to:
🔹 Ensure that React components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain.
🔹Produce “clean” and well-structured code, with detailed specifications. This means that my code is commented, well structured, readable and comes with documentation.
🔹 Identify, uphold and apply web engineering best practices
🔹 Review existing web app code, new code and plan future app upgrades with the development team

Mostly on all my serious remote projects, I was working in teams of up to 10 people.
I've collaborated with project managers, designers, system engineers, architectures, other front-end developers and back-end developers in an Agile environment across the entire product lifecycle.

What are the next steps?
