Hi!

We have 6 years of experience in developing fully-custom websites from scratch based on React/Js and helping clients like you to create a turnkey digital solution, so we can surely guarantee a quality up-to-date product release.

You can find our recent full stack website Brikk for an investment company in the EU by this link:
https://exore.pro/en/cases/real-estate-portal
Brikk is a real estate website for professionals that simplifies managing all company's key business tasks, relationships and interactions with customers. Brikk was built based on React/Js.

Our team(8 developers, a project manager and designer) provides the full-cycle project development: from wireframes & UI/UX design to front-/back-end, architectural decisions and technical support.

It would be great to learn more about your project and I suggest discussing tasks via video call to make sure that we are on the same wavelength with deliverables.

- When would it be convenient for you to have an introductory call to have a more detailed conversation about your project?

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Yury

Hello!

I'm Pasha a full-stack developer. I'm an expert with CSS, Javascript, React.js. And I'm familiar a little with Vue.js. So, I think we have a good match :)

I'm new to Upwork. But I have already 4 years of experience. And I'm ready to do my best for your project :)

I can start to work in a few days. Could we have a chat to discuss your project more?

Best regards :)
