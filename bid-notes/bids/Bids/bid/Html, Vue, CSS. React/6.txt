Front-end development part is my favorite and I am here to take the responsibility of assisting you with your project!
Just want to know when are you planning to start with it?
As I started my working career with Javascript more than 5 years ago, now I am an expert in all its technologies, libraries and frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js. I can start from scratch and create modern and high-quality code for you.
And here I don't want to write a long-listed and boring bid, just can say that by choosing me you will have the needed result quickly.
In addition to all, I want to show you some of my previous projects written in:
React.js - https://swag.com/
Vue.js- https://flattr.com/
Btw I am available to start right now and available for full-time work, so let's start together!
Hope to have your reply soon.


Regards,
Sergey
