Hello there!
I have over 7 years of experience in developing web applications for a large number of businesses. I’m familiar with advanced JS frameworks (Vue, React, Angular) and UX/UI design. Take a look at some of my previous works: https://budu.jobs/ , https://atlas-stars.ru , https://malevichspb.ru

Tell me more about your project please.
Have you got a design concept?
Do you have any developments?
What you prefer to use on backend?

Chat me to discuss all details!



Hi,

I see you are looking for a Vue.js, React developer, and I have a candidate who is a perfect match for your needs.

Let's discuss your requirements further. When would you have time to speak about it?

Thanks,
Dmitriy


Hi!

I'm Danila, I have 7+ years extensive experience using JavaScript (front-end) technologies. I specialize in the frontend development and I'm a person who will turn the design of any complexity into amazing work using LESS/SAAS, CSS/HTML and build the web project using React/Redux, JS, Firebase/React-Redux-Firebase, Angular, Vue.js, Typescript.

My recent React project was Zirra https://www.zirra.com/ - AI-powered market intelligence platform for researching and analyzing companies. Here I used React.js, React-admin, React-apollo, Immutable.js, Less and Meteor.

My recent Vue project was ENC http://energicos.de/ - CRM system for the energy supplier company. It’s based on the serverless backend and Vue.js 2.6.10, and here I worked with Vuetify 1.5.14 to create UI-controls, and Vuex 3.1.1 to keep information about current user. The app is hosted on AWS and uses Aws amplify components for Vue 0.2.11.

I am interested in collaboration and although I'm with mentalstack.com, there is still an option of direct communication. Let's schedule a call to discuss the details. When are you available?

Hope to talk to you soon.

Best,
Danila
