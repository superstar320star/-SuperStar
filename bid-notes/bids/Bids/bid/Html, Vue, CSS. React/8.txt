Hi, I'm ready to help you. Can you specify the task so I can understand the work objectives?
I have been working as a full-stack developer and have experience in React with Redux for over 6 years. I'm a typescript specialist, so I'm well-versed in Vue.js as well.

Moreover;
* Pretty good enough at customizing and implementing third-party APIs and Rest API. Also worked on JSON, SOAP.
* Experience in AWS, Azure, etc.
* Write robust & extensible code architecture
* Experienced in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Less, and Sass. Experienced in front-end tools like Webpack and Babel.
* Use Jest and Enzyme for unit testing.
* Have experience in Agile methodology.
* Have implemented CI/CD
* Familiar with project management tools like Jira, Basecamp, Asana, Mantis & TFS.
