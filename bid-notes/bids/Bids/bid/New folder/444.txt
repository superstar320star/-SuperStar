Hi. Thank you for interesting job post.

My name is Oleksii and I am a blockchain developer with strong experience in NFT development. I already have worked on many successful NFT projects in which I developed smart contracts or fully managed the tech side.

https://finalbosu.com/ (Unique hand drawn NFTs with play-to-learn game)
https://alienfrens.io/ (Generative NFT with large community)
https://www.dinobabies.io/ (Generative NFT to be used future film)
https://atopia.xyz/ (100% on-chain vector art NFT and P2E game)
...

Excluding the NFT projects, I also developed several complex DeFi smart contract including lending, swap, staking and yield aggregation platforms etc. So I have full confident that I can quickly get on the project and build the product in a short period time. I will provide full tech solution and manage the development process from very brief to end.

I can provide all necessary things for your NFT launch and selling including
- Smart contract implementing your idea and minting feature according to sale strategy.
- Random traits and art generation according to the rarity percentages
- Setup IPFS or server to serve metadata and images
- NFT sale site with all the necessary functionalities like wallet connect, max available items, minting etc.
- Integration with NFT marketplaces like Opensea, LooksRare and more
- If you have other gamifying logic or utility tokenomics in your project, it will be provided all together.

I'd like to hear the details of the project and potentially start good cooperation together to achieve the project goals
Looking forward to your reply.

Kind regards
