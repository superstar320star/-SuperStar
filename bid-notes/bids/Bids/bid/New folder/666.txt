Hello.
I am confident that I can understand the whole process of your project and deliver it successfully on time.
For the first, I rewrite your requirements as my understanding.
If there are two individuals ready, one (A) who want to sell his NFT and the other (B) who want to buy NFT, an escrow contract will be initialized.
Then B would transfer reasonable funds to the contract and A would transfer ownership of his NFT.
If B not receive any NFT in a week, will be refunded from contract.

Listing my experiences with Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC, Polygon, Tron and Solana.
