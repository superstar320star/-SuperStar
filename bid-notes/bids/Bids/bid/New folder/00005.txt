Hello,Sir.
I have read your post and thank God for getting me a chance to view your post.
I am a talented full stack and smart contract dev and really crazy about it.
To be honest with you, I am now studying on solana, so I think chances for me are really slim.
But I am perfect in solidity, web3 and if your project is not so urgent, I will sit up all night understanding solana and doing your project.
Because I am passionate and honest dev.

I am strong at these.
front-end: Web3_React_Next_Angular_Vue_Bootstrap_MUI_Tailwind,
back-end: Solidity_NodeJS_Express_Javascript_PHP_Laravel_CI,
database: MySQL_MongoDB_GraphQLj
network: Ethereum_Binance_Polygon_Solana

I have just done front-end project I envelope details below.
url : https://sale.ndb.money
design:https://www.figma.com/file/mgdZOTvjVyn1ekzeFSaaap/NDB-Token?node-id=69%3A7915
playground: https://sale.ndb.money/playground
I mainly took a role of front end design and graphql integration.

You could check https://www.skullsin.love/ runnning on polygon, and http://silverfoxinvestment.com by php frameworks.
That's all my works.
I hope at least one of this will help you later on.
Good luck with your business.
Thank you.
