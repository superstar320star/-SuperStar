Hello,Sir.
I have read your post and thank God for getting me a chance to view your post.
I am a talented full stack dev and really crazy about it.
I am passionate and honest dev.

I am strong at these.

back-end: Solidity_NodeJS_Express_Javascript_PHP_Laravel_CI,
database: MySQL_MongoDB_GraphQLj
network: Ethereum_Binance_Polygon_Solana

I have just done front-end project I envelope details below.

design:https://www.figma.com/file/mgdZOTvjVyn1ekzeFSaaap/NDB-Token?node-id=69%3A7915
playground: https://sale.ndb.money/playground
I mainly took a role of front end design and graphql integration.
