Hello,
I have reviewed your proposal and would like to be considered for the project. I currently have availability for this project and am available to start at your earliest convenience.

Here are some projects that I have previously worked on:
https://bitcoin-made-easy.com
https://joshwoodcolour.com/
https://lilledkoju.ee/
https://zontjk.com
https://heskethproperty.com

https://changingeducation.co.uk/home/ App (iOS/Android)
https://birdbox.film
http://www.markortech.com
https://www.emop.co.uk app (iOS/Android)

This is how I do the development phase
1. Project setup:
Create issue tracking boards(I prefer ClickUp, but Jira, Asana, Trello).
Create version control repository(needed to track changes history and deploy).
Setup deployment environments, ideally go with 3:
- staging
- pre-prod
- production
2. Development process depends on the technology of your choice, I’m familiar with:
Frontend:
1) HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, BEM - 8 years
2) JS, JQuery - 8 years
3) React.js, Vue.js, Redux.js - 6 years
4) GraphQL, Apollo - 3 years
5) Gatsby.js, Next.js - 4 years
6) TypeScript - 4 years
Backend:
1) Ruby (Ruby on Rails) - 2 years
2) PHP (Laravel, GraphQL) - 8 years
3) Shopify - 5 years
4) MySQL, PostgreSQL - 5 years
5) WordPress - 8 years
6) (WooCommerce), OpenCart - 4 years
3. Test coverage(optional, could be omitted to cut off the budget).
4. QA + Documentation.
5. Launch.

I’m ready to start as soon as needed. I look forward to hearing from you if you choose me for the job.

Kind regards,

Hi. How are you and your business?
