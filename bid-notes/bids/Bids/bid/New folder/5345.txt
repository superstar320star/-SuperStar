Take a look at some of our recent works:

💎 - Create is an OpenSea for internet memes and gaming-related NFTs. It is a full-feature project that allows users to mint, collect tokens, and run options. The most exciting thing that makes the project different is that Creates incorporates royalties in secondary sales. That means that artists can get royalty payments immediately on every secondary sale.
