Hi there.
I read your clear requirement carefully and I am really excited to let you know my opinion for your project.
1. I think the main thing is the data acquisition aspect of the website.
        Building website like Listsource and Propstream is not problem in my side because I am a professional website developer.
2. I think requiring user to sign up and paying a small fee are good position.
        That service to obtain information of homeowners would be more popular in others as well as US.
3. I think even data acquistion is important but building this website more comfortable and flexible         for customers using this website is more important. 
        Which means that is to make the user interface friendly to all users.
Regarding the all features in this project, I can upgrade for your intend because I have a deep knowledge about Vue.js and Flask.
If you think my opinion is useful for your project, Please contact me.
I hope to discuss further details regarding your project.
