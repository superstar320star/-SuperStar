Dear client.
I read your job carefully and I think your job needs a perfect and talented Vue and Vuex developer.
Vuex is the pattern and library for managment of state on the application.
The latest version of vue is 3.0.11 that was release April 2021.
After releasing that version, I started converting all my vue project in to it.
I have successfully worked out and it gives me the good experienced of converting the versions in vue.
Some advices:
    ---  I think it would be better for you to use NuxtJS framework because it support the server side rendering if possible.
          The website by only vue and vuex works by client side rendering so it has some cons about SEO and other options.
         Using Nuxt framework will make your website more flexible and refined.
   ---  In regard to optimizing of performance of your website.
         - Lazy Loading in Vue js
         - Code splitting based on Routes
         - Vue js Prefetch components
         -Optimize Third-party Library
         - Using Browser Cache
         - Optimizing and Compressing Images and etc

What I have to do ....
     ---- review the project code.
     ---- find the reason of slow performance and solution.
     ---- let you know via video chat.
     ---- making good performance in deadline.
     ---- making NuxtJS for the better production if you want.
I hope your business will be fine and I can be a great help....
Thank you.
