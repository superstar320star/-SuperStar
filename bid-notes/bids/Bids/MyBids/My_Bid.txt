We have some teams from US, Canada, Australia and Europe and work with them succesfully.
Please check our portfolios to get an idea of design quality:

Before we go into more details, let me clarify the following:

- Will you need only design or also development part to be done for the projects?

I have many other questions to ask but to save time for both of us I suggest to schedule a call/chat.
