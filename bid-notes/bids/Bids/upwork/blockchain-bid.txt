Let me tell You that we have great Blockchain expertise and we can help You with the project.
Please check some of our projects.

*NFT smart contract

- https://zestbloom.com/ZestBloom is a next generation Digital Media marketplace seeking to offer a brand new way of experiencing Crypto Art while simultaneously supporting and promoting artists for their contributions. It is built on Algorand (https://www.algorand.com/nft), one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains to date allowing to facilitate purchases and track ownership of assets, with significantly reduced fees and smaller carbon footprint.

*Blockchain

https://insightprediction.com Insight Prediction is a betting platform for different events (markets). Users get wallets for different crypto coins (USDC, BTC, ETH) to deposit money into the system, place bids for different events and convert between different crypto coins to withdraw the money from their account.
1. Perform complex calculations for share creation, as well as the resolved markets.
2. Show statistics on the profits, ROI, and the harmonic average based on the ranking.
3. While migrating markets from other platforms, convert into the respective format to be able to import into our platform.
4. Ensure a total synchronization of the platforms so that the market is updated immediately in our platform whenever it gets updated in the original platform. We have used WebSocket to ensure this synchronization.

I would be happy to set up a convenient time to talk about the requirements.
Cheers, Karapet

Take a look at some of our recent works:

💎 - Create is an OpenSea for internet memes and gaming-related NFTs. It is a full-feature project that allows users to mint, collect tokens, and run options. The most exciting thing that makes the project different is that Creates incorporates royalties in secondary sales. That means that artists can get royalty payments immediately on every secondary sale.

💎 - Goons of Balatroon is a cartoon NFT collection. Our team took part in building a stacking smart contract for a gaming project. We built the ERC20 token and front-end application. Gamers can stack NFTs and get rewards in ERC20 tokens.
