I'm a Full-Stack Developer and a Blockchain Developer with experience of working in positions/roles of a senior developer, team lead, and system architect. Predominantly in my projects, I was using MS SQL Server, C# .NET, ASP.NET Web API, and AngularJS because with this stack it's relatively easy to get the good speed of development and high-quality result at the end. I also have work experience with Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, Classic ASP, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, Knockout.js, and many more. I like creating fancy user interfaces as well as optimizing server code increasing services productivity. I'm familiar with design patterns and feel free to use them.
