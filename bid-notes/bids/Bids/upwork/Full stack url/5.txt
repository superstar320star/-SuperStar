I am the owner of Winterwind Software Services, which is a fast-growing software agency based in the Philippines, specializing in integrating blockchain technology into websites and mobile apps. I am also an Ex-Youtube Programming Instructor (search Anthony Vipond on Youtube) with 14K subscribers, an ex-Disney developer and a Laravel framework expert. Within the company I function like a technical PM, ensuring that only the highest quality goes out the door.

I am managing a team of developers and UI designers from my home in the Philippines. There are only senior developers within Winterwind and only the strong survive in this agency, whether they are developers, UI designers or project managers. Their work is all managed by me here and at no cost to you.

I have been using Laravel full-time since 2014 (Laravel 3). I have contributed to the Laravel framework source code and developed libraries for it as well. My specialty is working as a full-stack or back-end developer on Laravel-based projects.

Before I started Winterwind in 2018, I was a senior full-stack web developer. I also have extensive experience working with different blockchains such as BTC, Ethereum, EOS and more. I was the lead developer of LoyalCoin.io, the first cryptocurrency from the Philippines and Coinflyer.com, which is a cryptocurrency exchange that supports multiple different blockchains. I have also worked on high-traffic websites in the past including Disney.com and one of the busiest real-estate websites in the world, Juwai.com. Our specialties here at Winterwind are Laravel, PHP, MySQL, Vue.js, CSS and integrating any blockchain into mobile or website applications.
