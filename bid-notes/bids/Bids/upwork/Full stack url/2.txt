My passion is solving real programming problems in the world. I used to build projects using Laravel and other frameworks to solve interesting problems. Moreover, for that, I have the experience and the ability to serve or to work with you or your team.
I am also experienced in ReactJS, VueJS, NUXTJS, NEXTJS, JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Material Design, Java, CSharp, Kotlin, VB.NET, Database Programming and Mobile Development (Android).

Besides, for me, the Web is changing the medium of everything the way we work and also with it comes to business's concern. Moreover, I want to be part of it and I want to contribute, not because of “money” but because of the impact that it gave to the audience and the business itself. Because in my real work and real project it can boost and help other people to achieve their goals or any activities.
