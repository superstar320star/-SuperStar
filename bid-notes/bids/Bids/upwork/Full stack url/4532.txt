I am Prabhash, and I am a Full Stack Developer for over ten years now. I work with a small team, and we have experience shipping out Full stack applications and SaaS platforms to production.

Our primary stack is Angular/React with NodeJs as the backend to build mobile/web apps. We majorly work with SaaS companies & platforms and build various apps. Our frontend stack is Angular/React with TypeScript, RxJS, ngRx, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Sass for our CSS. In the backend, we prefer to use NestJS with TypeScript and PostgreSQL/firebase. If needed we also offer end-to-end development of the product, including design. You can see our Dribbble profile at
