I have a good practice of unit testing, code source documentation, API documentation and testing, TDD, token authentication, etc. I have knowledge of version control systems/source code control tools like GIT, Jira, Bitbucket, SVN, etc and my experience is not limited to these.

I believe communication is the key to unlocking any successful outcome. Let's discuss the project in detail. Once done I will tell you the time estimation based on the exact requirement.

Looking forward to your response and having a word with you.

Thank you.
