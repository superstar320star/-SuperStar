Drupal is the main era of my expertise. I played a lot with Drupal (Custom Back-end, front-end, custom module/theme development, hooks/api's/extending classes). I am aware of all technicalities of Drupal Development, whether it is Drupal 6, Drupal 7, or Drupal 8. I am aware of the fact that Drupal 8 is totally different from D6/D7 in terms of coding. But I loved the architecture and coding standards that D8 offers.

Other Skills:
PHP (PHP 5 and PHP 7)
WordPress (Great Command on Front-end Theming, Backend Plugin Development )
CiviCRM (worked on custom extensions too)

Laravel
Codeigniter
Cake PHP
Huge Framework

Node JS
Angular
ReactJS

Bootstrap/Foundation/ HTML5
jQuery/JS
Ajax
SCSS/LESS/CSS

My plus factor is that my husband is UI/UX Developer, so I never have to seek any designing help from outside. So, I would be like a complete Development package.

Having a good logical and understanding level let me handle any kind of development work very easily. As Technologies keep changing, so is necessary to keep yourself updated with the latest market trends, and it is not possible without a good command over logics.

When you come to me with a concept in your mind, I will be for sure able to turn your ideas into reality.

Price is negotiable for long term contracts!!

Hello, I see you are looking for a full stack developer.

We started off with a set schedule on when we had deadlines, and Hendrik would always be ahead of schedule and never behind. I will continue to work with Hendrik for this current project, and any future ones to come. Thanks again, Hendrik

above is one of my client's feedback for building a high-quality website for job searching by using react.js on frontend and django rest framework on backend.

One of the most high-quality products I built is roompricegenie.com, where we won 12 awards for startup competitions including ‚ÄúMOST INNOVATIVE STARTUP OF THE YEAR‚Äù from phocuswright (https://up-link.blankontech.com/showcase/?phocuswright_link_reference=rpg-phocuswright-148).

I built roompricegenie with high-quality code structure using react.js as main framework, redux for state management, material-ui for styling, axios for http request library and docker to run all services.

main reason why i'm using react is because of it's scalability, we can easly expand to mobile app using react native by sharing non-ui code, so this will save time on development as well.

and on backend side with high-quality architecture using python-django rest API, postgresql, django-channels for socket communication and celery to handle scheduled background tasks.

Room Price Genie's goal isn‚Äôt to disrupt the way smaller hotels work, but to make it easier, keeping their prices competitive and their hotels busy, means even small properties can have automated high-quality pricing. And increase revenue by 15% effortlessly.

Roompricegenie is expert partner revfine optimising revenue:
