React has been one of my front-end frameworks for the last 5+ years and used to build the various SPAs. I mainly focus on the front-end development using React.
I mainly focused on React Native(Typescript) for building beautiful Front-End and so now, I should state that I have in-depth experiences with them.
I also have experience in Ruby on Rails, AWS and Go.

I will do my best to meet your expectation and I will never let you down.
Looking forward to your contact via adri.m2185353@gamil.com.

Best Regard.
